In the list of "craziest things I've created," Desmos Plane is probably
        at the top of the list. I created an entire programming language to make
        this project. I built thousands of polygons of hand-optimized geometry
        to make this project. I spent weeks honing my skills in developing
        performant graphs to a fine, razor-sharp edge to make this project.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>LISPsmos</h2> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Let's start from the beginning with the tool I used to make Desmos Plane
        in the first place: LISPsmos. LISPsmos is&mdash; in short&mdash; a
        programming language that compiles to Desmos expressions. It roughly
        follows LISP syntax, with S-expressions, but is by no means a full LISP
        implementation or anything of the sort. You can find the source code for
        LISPsmos <a href="https://github.com/radian628/lispsmos" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>here</a>, both
        the old TypeScript implementation I used for Desmos Plane and the new
        (incompatible, I might add) Racket implementation I've been using for
        later projects.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
I won't get into how LISPsmos works in this breakdown. Put simply, it's
        like if you took all Desmos features, translated them into text, and put
        them in Polish Notation.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
But why not just implement Desmos Plane within Desmos directly? There
        are several problems with doing this. One particularly bad problem is
        the sheer complexity of some of the expressions within Desmos Plane.
        While Desmos is nice for writing short expressions, it suffers greatly
        when writing longer expressions, because these can often overflow the
        small expression boxes that Desmos gives. Since Desmos has no line
        breaks, these go off the screen and require a long, tedious scrolling
        process to navigate. LISPsmos, on the other hand, is entirely
        text-based, and thus allows me to logically split up these massive
        expressions with line breaks.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Another problem with using Desmos directly is the need for code
        generation within Desmos Plane. Code generation is when code generates
        code. I needed to use this to create lists of 3D mesh data to store the
        game's levels, among other things, like level triggers. LISPsmos was
        very nice for this because of its simple AST&mdash; rather than
        undergoing the error-prone process of generating LaTeX strings for
        Desmos, I could create a LISPsmos AST.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>The Start of Desmos Plane</h2> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vkgetj1klr?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Above is the first graph of what eventually became Desmos Plane. It's
        little more than a 3D renderer with a static scene, depth-sorted
        polygons, and lambertian shading. The project was implemented in
        LISPsmos. The assets were created within Blender. To color them, I used
        Blender's "vertex color" system&mdash; a relatively crude method, but it
        gave me the exact, per-polygon control I needed. They were then exported
        as .PLY files and converted into Desmos lists. I was using this draft to
        run performance tests on my old laptop to ensure that it would run fast
        on more modern devices&mdash; I knew from the beginning that I would
        have to fine-tune this to an absurd degree.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Movement and Collisions</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gltnvxalew?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This next update added collisions and movement. It's still quite crude,
        but amazingly, it works. I used the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Moller-Trumbore Ray-triangle Intersection Formula</a>
to figure out whether the plane (modeled as a line segment from its
        previous to its next position) intersects the scene (modeled as a list
        of triangles).
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Fog and "Lazy" Camera</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/c2p84khwsg?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Note: You'll have to start the ticker manually for this one. In this
        update I experimented with two new features. The first one is fog that
        fades into the distance, eventually blending the farthest polygons in
        with the background. In hindsight, I probably should have included this
        in the final product. The other is a "lazy" camera. Before, the camera
        would follow the plane exactly. Now, the camera trails the plane from
        behind. It has an actual position and a target position. Every frame,
        the actual position is moved closer to the target position by an amount
        of distance proportional to the distance between the actual and target
        position. The result is that the camera lazily follows the plane, but
        picks up the pace if it gets too far away.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Dynamic Lighting and Dynamic Loading</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9oykzmzf9v?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
You'll have to manually start the ticker for this one too (go to the
        actual Desmos site rather than the embed). At this point I had expanded
        the map quite a bit. This version introduced two new features: Changing
        the background color and dynamic lighting. The former is simply the
        ability to change the color the background fades to, intended for
        "underground" sections where I'd want the background to fade to black
        instead of blue. The latter refers to lights that change how they work
        at runtime&mdash; in this case the flickering light of a torch in a
        tunnel. The tunnel is quite far away from the start so you might have to
        give it a few tries before you're able to get the plane there.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
One <em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>very important</em> feature I also added at this stage was
        dynamic terrain loading. As you've probably realized by now, Desmos is
<em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>slow</em>. As a result, I don't want to draw any more polygons than
        I need to. Consequently, I developed a system for dividing up the world
        into sections, only a few of which I render. The way I do this is by
        dividing the world into sections and assigning a "viewbox" to each
        section, specified by a wireframe cube within Blender. When the plane is
        within a terrain piece's viewbox, that terrain piece is displayed.
        Otherwise, it isn't, and thus does not factor into the calculations. For
        further speedup, I only recalculate the displayed terrain pieces once
        every second or so.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>The Beginnings of a Game</h2> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/a7wfqg7dma?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This update brought quite a few changes. The most striking one is the
        new map: I decided to abandon the test map and attempt to make something
        with more scenery and with more intent on being an engaging level. The
        other one&mdash; which won't be visible unless you reach the end of the
        map&mdash; is the checkpoint system: The game now informs you that
        you've reached a new level ("Checkpoint", in this case) and saves your
        progress. Finally, I also got rid of the dynamic lighting for
        performance reasons. You'll soon see that becoming a trend.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Main Menu</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ngwgwcc9pz?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This update added a menu system to Desmos Plane, as well as a work in
        progress level select screen. The menu screen is just a piece of terrain
        positioned far away from the rest of the level.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Phone Mode</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kqial3a2vv?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This update to Desmos Plane added Phone Mode. Phone Mode is expected to
        be played in portrait mode. It moves the controller near the bottom of
        the screen to avoid one's finger from blocking their view.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>The Rewrite</h2> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3rrmensbcz?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
At this point I began to realize that Desmos Plane was running a bit
        slow. As a result, I decided to rewrite the entire engine from scratch.
        Above is an early build of the engine. Once again, you'll need to enter
        this one on Desmos itself to try it, since the ticker isn't enabled by
        default.
</p> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/uukuvujqwx?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Here is a much more complete build of the rewrite, containing nearly all
        of the features I had previously. I also did a bit of playtesting and
        came to the conclusion that the start of the game was far too difficult.
        To remedy this, I made a new first level and made it far easier than the
        previous one, with gentle turns to get the player used to the controls.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
You'll also see a few other changes here and there. The level select
        screen now has "lock" and "star" icons. The lock icon determines whether
        a level is complete. The star icon determines whether you have collected
        a star for the level. Around this period of development, I had a "star"
        feature&mdash; there was a star in each level in a difficult-to-reach
        location. However, I eventually abandoned the idea.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Another very visible change I implemented at this stage was the grass.
        This was another feature I eventually removed&mdash; it clashed somewhat
        with the low-poly aesthetic of the game, had performance issues, and did
        not play nicely with the depth sorting.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Graphical Improvements</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6kvoz4ytti?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This next update brought with it a variety of graphical improvements. If
        you look at the previous build, you'll notice that the polygons are all
        a flat color. In this update, I re-added shading, giving polygons a
        slight variation in color. However, unlike the original shading (which I
        removed for&mdash; you guessed it&mdash; performance reasons), this
        shading is calculated at compile time. Consequently, it has zero
        performance penalty at runtime.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Another change you'll notice is the inclusion of a settings menu. This
        currently only lets the user toggle grass and phone mode. I also kept
        phone mode in the main menu so users know that this game can be played
        on a mobile device.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
A third, very conspicuous feature I added is the sun. The sun is just a
        few parametric circles behind all the geometry. An additional set of
        ray-triangle intersections is used to determine whether to display the
        sun. The lens flare consists of several points which exist on the line
        segment connecting the sun and the center of the screen, scaled based on
        the distance from the sun to the center of the screen.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Compile-time Shadow Casting</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/x01ihri17z?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
I made a subtle change to Desmos Plane during this update: I changed the
        color scheme. Before, it was much more vibrant and saturated. This
        update muted the colors somewhat. I found that this made it look a lot
        better, and made the green grass less jarring. I came up with this color
        scheme by putting the colors next to one another and messing around with
        a color picker until I found specific shades I liked.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This update also implements one of the features I am most proud of in
        this project: Compile-time shadow casting. Up until this point, Desmos
        Plane had no casted shadows. Objects could be shaded due to their
        orientation, but they could not be shaded due to the presence of another
        object. This changed here.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
There are two issues that make casted shadows in Desmos extremely
        difficult. The first is that Desmos polygons can only be a single color.
        No gradients; nothing like that. Just one flat color. Consequently, I
        have to subdivide a triangle if I want multiple colors. The second
        problem that results from this is that having casted shadows means more
        triangles, which means potentially more lag. And I don't want lag.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Fortunately, I came up with a solution to generate casted shadows at
        compile-time which are <em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>good enough</em>. The algorithm first takes
        every single vertex in the scene, and casts a ray out of that vertex,
        towards the light source. The rays that reach the light source are lit
        up; the rays that get blocked are dark. If all three vertices of a
        triangle are lit up, I assume that that triangle is entirely lit up, and
        ignore it. If all three vertices of a triangle are dark, I assume that
        the triangle is entirely dark, decrease its brightness accordingly, and
        ignore it after that.
</p> <img src="castedshadows1.png" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
The interesting thing happens when I find a triangle with some bright
        vertices and some dark vertices. It can either have one bright and two
        dark; or two bright and one dark. Either way, two of its edges will
        connect a bright vertex to a dark vertex. This means that somewhere
        along those two edges, the triangle will switch from dark to light, or
        vice-versa in the other direction. Therefore, I can cast out additional
        rays out of positions on that edge to figure out where on that edge it
        switches from dark to light. The fastest way to do this is with a binary
        search, repeatedly halving the interval along the edge at which the
        boundary may occur.
</p> <img src="castedshadows2.png" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Once I find out where along each edge the triangle switches color, I
        have two points. I then cut the triangle in half through those two
        points, giving me a triangle and a quadrilateral, which itself can be
        decomposed into two more triangles. I'll color these accordingly. In the
        end, the result is a surprisingly convincing casted shadow.
</p> <img src="castedshadows3.png" class="long-image" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
Of course, there are limitations of this method: For one thing, it fails
        to detect thin geometry, because none of the vertices of a large
        triangle may be occluded by it. It also may give unexpected results if
<em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>multiple</em> boundaries exist on a light-dark vertex. And, on top
        of that, even when it does reproduce the approimate shape of a shadow,
        it ignores the fine details smaller than the size of a polygon. One of
        its biggest limitations is that it's too prohibitively slow to run in
        realtime or even in Desmos at all&mdash; I did all this shadow-casting
        business in TypeScript; Desmos only gets the output mesh to play with.
        As a result, lights can't move. However, like with everything in
        computer graphics, you can never accurately reproduce everything. And
        after flying through the levels a few times, I decided that it was
<em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>good enough</em>.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Clouds</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cwhrxcqtpp?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This update added clouds. The clouds are a collection of coordinate
        points behind the rest of the geometry. They are also toggleble within
        the settings menu, just like the grass.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
The observant viewer may also noticed that I switched from SemVer to
        CalVer. Eventually I even dropped CalVer, feeling too lazy to keep up
        any kind of versioning scheme.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Timers</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ekf45jva3a?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
This next update introduced a way of timing runs, as well as the
        bronze/silver/gold system, encouraging users to get the best times along
        with completing the level. As you likely noticed, it's somewhat buggy at
        this stage.
</p> <h3 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Aggressive Performance Optimization</h3> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/agzdgq6kxu?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
At this stage, Desmos Plane hit a turning point. I was debating whether
        I should focus on making the game <em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>look good</em> or
<em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>run fast</em>. I had no idea what to do in this regard because it
        was already quite fast, routinely reaching 30+ FPS on modern devices.
        However, at the same time, on mobile devices it was far slower and on
        older devices (such as my 2015 Macbook Air) it ran at about 5-10 FPS. I
        ultimately made the decision that it would be better to focus on
        performance, not aesthetics.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
In hindsight, I don't know if this was a good decision. My laptop is an
        outlier in terms of its low poor performance, being made in 2015 and not
        super high end. Most laptops actively being used are newer. Newer,
        mid-range devices, as stated before, generally ran Desmos Plane at
        smooth framerates. On the other hand, given that this is Desmos we're
        talking about, one possible audience for Desmos Plane is cheap, low-end
        school computers. While this test is by no means scientific, I tried
        running Desmos Plane on a relatively new school computer, only for it to
        run at an unplayable 1-2 FPS. While this would suggest that I should
        increase performance, that level of performance increase is also
        essentially unobtainable given how much optimization I have done
        already. As a result, it would have been better to cut my losses and
        focus on aesthetics. On top of that, I was submitting this project to
        the desmos <em data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>Art</em> contest. While the judges explicitly noted that
        they cared about performance, I think I lost sight of the larger goal of
        making something aesthetically pleasing.
</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>The Release</h2> <iframe src="/breakdowns/desmos-plane/lazy-iframe.html?url=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dbrcz5kn1i?embed" height="500" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder="0" data-astro-cid-s4mxocay></iframe> <p data-astro-cid-s4mxocay>
At this point, the only major change I was making was adding levels and
        making minor bugfixes. This is the final result of that&mdash; the first
        official release of Desmos Plane. This isn't the one that's most widely
        known, nor is it the one that I submitted to Desmos in the end. But this
        is the first version I consider complete.

This is the Desmos Plane I ultimately submitted to the art contest after
        making a few minor patches.
