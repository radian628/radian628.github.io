# My Relationship with Right-wing Edgelordery

This is an essay about my experiences growing up with right-wing politics, how I got sucked into the alt-right's grasp, and how I eventually escaped. I intend this to be a reflection on how I felt growing up, as well as an instructional guide for those wanting to prevent others from getting sucked into right-wing politics.

Do keep in mind reading this that I'm going to be explaining _why_ I believed what I did and why I acted how I did growing up. In this I am not trying to excuse my bad behavior. If, on the offchance, you _are_ someone reading this now that has been negatively affected by my behavior, I am not trying to convince you to forgive me. Rather, I am trying to provide insight into _why people act like right-wing edgelords_ and _how to make them stop_.

## What do I even mean by "right-wing edgelord"?

Long story short, I'm not referring to your average right-wing boomer grandpa. I'm referring to the alt-right or "alt-lite" sort of person who frequently uses the internet and makes lots of bigoted "jokes" and the like. Like your average late-2010s 4chan user.

## Getting Indoctrinated

I've identified four factors that I think led to me getting sucked into the right-wing rabbit hole. These are:

- Pop Feminism
- Social Rejection
- Fetishization of "Logical Thinking"
- Bullying

### Pop Feminism

Looking back, the thing that first planted the seeds of right-wing edgelordery in my mind was my negative experience with what I'm calling "pop feminism." To me, "pop feminism" is the late-2000s, early-2010s brand of "feminist" rhetoric which tried to empower women and girls and encourage them to gain new skills and do X, Y, and Z activity associated with a high-paying career.

Now this in and of itself is a good thing. Women have been locked out of high-paying careers for most of the history of Western civilization and it's time we finally gave them adequate room at the table. However, the way this deluge of information was presented to me&mdash; a male child&mdash; left a lot to be desired, because _I did not notice any of these structural disadvantages women faced_. As far as I was told, it was all "girls empowerment" this, "girls empowerment" that, like some secret club. I was never told as a young child the _actual reason why_ schools and pop culture were singling out empowering _girls in particular_.

_As far as I could tell_ as a clueless child, women and girls were simply being given unfair treatment. They just felt like an exclusive club of People Who Were Allowed To Succeed, one from which half the population&mdash; myself included&mdash; was to be left out. Add to this the societal expectation of men being disposable, self-sufficient breadwinners, and I felt like I was being left behind and that no support network would ever care for me. "Man up," I was told. "Toughen up." It was profoundly alienating.

This brand of "pop feminism" also had a weird undercurrent of disdain for men at times, mainly in a "boomer wife who hates her husband" sort of way rather than a "social justice" sort of way. For instance, in media embodying pop feminism, the female characters in media would be portrayed as hard-working know-it-all geniuses whereas the male characters would be lazy, incompetent brutes. Rather than abolish gender roles, it simply reinterpreted and subverted them while _still keeping them in place_, presumably in a way that would appease the average boomer wife who was nominally pro-women's rights but was a _little too uncomfortable_ with gender nonconformance to take them to their logical conclusion.

When I started expanding my media consumption beyond just what my parents and my school showed me, the alt-right provided a convenient solution: Women are trying to get special treatment in a society that already values them and sees them as equal to men! And with the limited information I had at the time, this _seemed_ like the most reasonable explanation. You'll see this pattern a _lot_ more&mdash; I'd feel alienated by some aspect of the society around me, only for right-wing grifters to swoop in and save the day with an unnaturally convenient Faustian bargain.

### Social Rejection

I experienced a second bout of radicalization when I learned enough about myself to realize I was not doing well socially in school. For much of my childhood I never really got along with anyone. I'd say off-color things, I'd get really mad at people for inconsequential nonsense, and I rarely ever related to things most other people enjoyed.

In hindsight, there were a few reasons why this was the case. One of these was autism. I had a few inconsequential autism-related behaviors that people would just make fun of for no good reason.

This isn't to say I didn't have any genuinely bad behaviors; I had quite a few of those&mdash; I would often say off-color, sometimes disturbing things, perhaps another consequence of autism.

Another was a profound misunderstanding of the way the average person behaved. I imagined the average person to be far more jaded and malicious than they really were, perhaps because this is the way my Dad viewed other people, but also because this was the way I viewed YouTube commenters, which due to my internet access at a young age I grew far too familiar with. You know the types&mdash; the ones that use "kill yourself" as a greeting. Fun.

A third reason for my lack of social adjustment was just my lack of exposure to American pop culture in general&mdash; neither of my parents were involved much in interests or hobbies that my peers shared, so I was never really able to relate to those peers. Both of them spent much of their formative years outside of the US, and I don't think either really ever assimilated fully.

Of course, as a child, I didn't see any of this. I just saw myself unable to talk to others without mockery and scorn, a shameful attack against my right to free speech! And what better enemy of "free speech" than a vague, nebulous definition of "political correctness"? I saw "political correctness" as the main reason why I couldn't speak my mind; why I couldn't relate to others. People aren't getting mad at my behavior because I'm being obnoxious, or even because they're being ableist&mdash; they're getting mad _because they're sensitive snowflakes trying to be politically correct_. And, as such, it became a boogeyman I could point to if I needed something to blame for my social mishaps.

### Fetishization of "Logical Thinking"

Throughout most of my childhood, I learned one simple rule: That my emotions were my own damn fault. That if I was bothered by something, it was just tough shit and I shouldn't complain. That my reactions to being mistreated were entirely my choice, and as such that I should _always_ take the "high road".

This was hammered into me by so many people throughout my life. By my father, who would intentionally bother me to get a rise out of me, only to tell me that it's _my_ responsibility to not react. By staff at school, who made it clear that all emotional reactions I had were conscious choices perfectly within my control. By trolls on the internet who would say something absurd just to provoke reactions from others, blaming me for "falling for it" if I responded negatively. All this turned emotional expression into something I felt I should avoid. That I should be cold, detached, and rational, able to see the world for what it _really_ is. I decided that I'd stake my claim in this island of rationality and make it the base on which I would build my entire personality.

As such, when I saw people protesting oppression&mdash; like Black Lives Matter protests and the like&mdash; I didn't see that this was natural response to mistreatment, nor did I see that their emotional appeals were actually quite effective to the average person. I just saw a bunch of whiny social justice warriors trying to guilt-trip their opponents into conceding their points instead of doing what they were _supposed_ to do: Dismantling their opponents' reasoning with _logic_.

To me, any sort of emotional expression was a moral failing, a sign that one hadn't achieved the bare minimum of self-control. It was a concession that one wasn't fit to engage in the rational dialogue that sets humanity apart from nearly the entirety of the animal kingdom. I even saw it as malicious, a way of trying to emotionally blackmail others into becoming emotional themselves to eventually win them over. Committing the crime of expressing emotions was _one thing_; getting _others_ to do it too was&mdash; to me&mdash; a whole new level of evil.

More than that, however, I saw it as bad praxis. To me, the only real, ethical, _effective_ form of protest was a rational dialogue; a truth-seeking debate. After all, _everything_ is beholden to logic, right? Given the same base axioms, we _must_ derive our way toward the same conclusion, right?

It might not be clear how this fetishization of logic intersects with right-wing politics until you realize that an obsession with "logical thinking" was the way the online right-wing branded itself, regardless of how much logic was _actually_ involved. May I remind you that it was the likes of Ben Shapiro who were most strongly associated with phrases like "DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC"? I found myself watching such content because it appealed to this detached, hyper-logical being that I wished to become.

### Bullying

Up to this point, everything I had experienced wasn't really _that_ big of a deal. My gripes with pop feminism alone would've been dealt with via proper education. My social rejection would eventually subside later on in high school and in college. My "logical thinking" obsession, at the very least, was predicated on an assumption that minorities deserved rights and that their methods for acquiring those rights were just ineffective. But getting bullied into submission cut me in a deeper way that would affect my actual behavior.

Most of this bullying took place over the internet. Most of it was your standard-issue "take advantage of the clueless 14-year-old's naivete to provoke reactions out of them by saying absurd or shocking things." Most of the things people said were the sorts of vile things you'd expect from internet commenters&mdash; racial slurs, homophobia, telling people to kill themselves, y'know, the whole nine yards. At first I would fight back against such content, finding it vile and disturbing and, well, a dick move.

But as I began to ingratiate myself further into these online communities, I found it harder and harder to keep pushing back against such behavior. Any resistance would be seen as an open invitation to target me further, as my behavior would have painted me as an easy target. And so, I felt that the only way I could felt like I belonged was simply to _join them_.

This might seem like a problem with a fairly trivial solution. Why not just _leave_? This seems like an easy solution. In fact, if I found myself joining an online community that ended up having such an issue _today_, I _would_ just leave. But I had no confidence at this point of time. I was a 14-year-old loser with hardly any good in-person friends. I would often fight with the few friends I _did_ have. Online communities were to me a reprieve from this crippling loneliness. As such, leaving one of them was tantamount to me leaving all of my friends. And given my aforementioned fear of people being jaded and malicious, I was absolutely terrified of rejection.

And so I became the frog in the boiling pot. Day after day, I'd cross more and more lines. Insults, slurs, and opinions that were once off-limits would become taboo things I'd say for shock value, and eventually just commonplace phrases I'd repeat like nobody's business. I began to see the edgelord right-wingers' behavior as normal as I became more entrenched in their online forums, priding myself on my ability to mold myself to these communities that would otherwise not have accepted someone like myself. I had gained a community who accepted me... but at what cost?

## Escape and Takeaways

As of 2024, I've long escaped the right-wing pipeline. Below are many of the factors that led to my escape, along with a variety of strategies I believe others might find useful either for escaping themselves, or for helping others escape.

So here's my advice that hopefully ends up becoming helpful to someone:

### Escape the Pipeline

I mean, at this point this practically goes without saying. Don't get yourself caught up in the right-wing edgelord pipeline if you can get away with it.

### Teach People about Social Issues (in the present day)

As I stated near the beginning of this rant, I took great issue with "pop feminism" from a young age because I felt that it needlessly gendered a wide swath of things, putting girls on a pedestal for seemingly no reason. Of course there _was_ a reason&mdash; just look at how women have been treated for most of recorded human history. But like I said earlier, I was not told about any of this history until much later in life. I was just a child&mdash; not even out of elementary school&mdash; forming judgements on whatever information flowed my way. If I had actually been _told_ the history of women's rights, perhaps I never would have seen "pop feminism" as misandry.

#### Start young

In a more general sense, teach people about discrimination from a young age, and _actually teach it well_. I was effectively told by omission at a young age that racism, sexism, and a whole load of other societal issues were "solved" in the modern day. That after segregation was over, all the white people and black people lived together in harmony happily ever after. That after the women's suffrage movement, women and men lived happily ever after. That after Columbus set down in the Americas and after a little battle or two, the "Indians" showed him how to grow corn and he established trade with them and they all lived happily ever after. I learned all about history, but never about the present day, so as a white-passing, fairly affluent person who scarcely experienced these issues myself, I just thought that they had all vanished by the time I was born, and therefore that everyone who complained about such issues was looking for special treatment.

I also think it's important that these issues are taught _early_ to avoid anchoring bias. "Anchoring bias" is a phenomenon where a person is biased towards the point of view they hear first. In my case, I heard that discrimination was only a thing of the past first, and due to this anchoring bias I was presupposed to believe that anything to the contrary was false&mdash; particularly the idea that discrimination still occurs in the present day.

#### Memes and propaganda

On another note, focus on teaching people about the propaganda they'll face on a day-to-day basis. I think internet memes are particularly effective for this. They're like modern-day propaganda posters: Short, snappy, and often designed to get a point across, yet often multilayered and rife with analysis potential if you look at the context under which they were written. More importantly, the average child could be exposed to dozens of them every day.

### Touch Grass

I can't emphasize this enough. Hang out with people in your local circle instead of only on the internet, where fringe weirdos can congregate and congeal and reach critical mass. It's much easier to curate the people around you online, so it's much easier to form echo chambers online. Not to mention the fact that it's far more impersonal online, giving people an outlet to say offensive things they wouldn't normally say.

Perhaps the biggest factor I can identify for my own escape is this fact&mdash; that I _got off the internet_. I decided that the online communities I had been participating in were negatively affecting my mental health and consequently decided to cut them off practically in their entirety. Around that time, I had also gained more real-life friends who'd hang out with me too often for me to even have the time to slip back into fringe, right-wing internet communities. The fact that there were communists among them helped too, exposing me to leftist ideas I hadn't even heard of my entire life up to that point.

Even _before_ I escaped the right-wing internet communities, there were at times where my offline friends gave me reality checks. I have one distinct memory of running a Minecraft server where I made the mistake of letting my online and offline friends mingle together. Many of my online friends thought it would be funny to start copying and pasting loads of Nazi swastikas all over the game map. My offline friends were, understandably, not too thrilled by this. While at the time I desperately tried to reconcile the situation in a "neutral" manner to keep "both sides" happy, I was internally in a state of conflict. Was copying and pasting swastikas everywhere _really_ a "normal" behavior? Was it really "haha funny shock value"? Or did it just make me look like a Nazi?

### Don't Give Children Unrestricted Internet Access

On a related note, don't give children unrestricted internet access. I say this because my jaded views of human beings and much of my offensive humor came from the internet. Now, I don't really know what restricting internet access looks like in practice. I got a computer from a young age, and to be honest, with the degree of computerization happening in every sphere of the modern world, I don't see how you could avoid giving a child a computer (at least in the US) at _some point_ without stunting their growth in some way.

You could say you'd just monitor all their activity, but that's only viable up to a certain point and is a massive time investment. Furthermore, if you _do_ monitor activity, you better be prepared, because if they want to do something without their knowledge they may very well find a way to bypass it. And this isn't even mentioning all the privacy implications of watching everything your child does on the internet.

I think (with my admittedly very limited opinion as a non-parent) that the best thing one can do as a parent in regard to kids' internet access is to be a person they can talk to if something _does_ go wrong. If a kid is harassed by a troll, they should be able to go to their parents and work through what happened with them rather than just bottling it up, fearing that they'll get all their internet access (and perhaps their friend group) cut off. If they hear something controversial or inappropriate, they should be able to go to their parents who can _explain to them what it all means_ without fear. If they feel like they _can't_ talk to their parents without punishment for doing things they aren't "allowed" to do on the internet, they're just going to do it anyway and then not tell their parents when something goes wrong.

### Be Careful with Slurs and Offensive Humor

I once had the idea that I could make offensive jokes freely because if people found them uncomfortable, they could just tell me and I'd stop. This reasoning _seems_ like it should work, but there are a number of pitfalls to it:

- How will someone know they can ask you to stop?
- How will someone know that you won't take advantage of their discomfort to deliberately use offensive humor around them? You could be the most well-intentioned person in the world, but _how will they know that_?
- If information _does_ leak, what happens?

The takeaway is that slurs and offensive humor should be _off_ by default. If you're going to make them, make sure you're _actually_ in an environment where you're _sure_ that your offensive humor will only reach the set of people you _know_ are fine with it and _know_ won't radicalize them. Don't make offensive jokes in a public space even if they're only directed at a few people you know, and don't treat silence as consent to make offensive jokes.

#### A note on slurs in particular

I think people also overcomplicate slurs at times. There aren't any no-no words that you Must Never Say Under Any Circumstances. Say whatever slurs you want if you're all alone. Not like anyone is around to care. I also think that concepts like "N-word passes" are ridiculous if you think about them for more than a few seconds. Say you get an "N-word pass" from one particular black person. Does that give you license to say the N-word around a _different_ black person? Sure, the original one might not care at _all_ that you say it, but that doesn't mean the _other_ one will be fine with it either.

I know that most people probably N-word passes to be a joke, but it _really_ makes no sense, especially when you apply it to _other_ actions often considered objectionable. Say a black person gives you a "punch me" pass. The reason why doesn't matter; maybe you're sparring in a martial arts competition. Does that then give you license to punch any other black person? No, of course not. There's no "special rules" on racial slurs or other slurs for that matter; it's just a matter of being kind to those around you and respecting their wishes.

### Don't Enforce Ideological Purity

This is for the ones helping those escape the Pipeline: Don't take it too quickly and don't immediately enforce ideological purity; that they conform to your specific breed of leftism or progressivism or whatnot. These things happen in steps, and I think there's a few things in particular to avoid, which I'll outline below.

#### Don't tell them how their own brain works

This is a big one. Imagine you're the average "logic"-obsessed rightwing edgelord. You think you're at the top of the world because you've mastered logical thinking and can see the world without bias.

Then, someone goes and tells you that you&mdash; like everyone around you&mdash; have nearly-uncontrollable subconscious racism and are therefore racist. To you this is an affront to the entire theme on which you've based your identity. That even though you've gone through effort to become a detached, logical thinker, you're _actually_ just emotional and biased. Moreover, an accusation like this implies that some random person out there _knows you better than you know itself_, which seems patently absurd. What kind of _hubris_ do they think they have to claim they know your mind better than you know your own? And with an accusation as damning and severe as _racism_, no doubt!

#### Avoid academic definitions

Speaking of racism, stay away from academic definitions if you can. The moment you throw out a word like "racism," "communism," or my favorite, "toxic masculinity," you're competing with a preestablished definition potentially created with the intent of scaremongering by bad-faith actors. It establishes a negative gut reaction from the start. It invites suspicion. It makes you sound like an elitist.

Instead of using academic terms, try to derive your thoughts from first principles. Don't tell people they should support women in STEM and expect them to listen if they've had no reason to do so in the past&mdash; tell them the history explaining why they've been locked out of such fields for so long so they understand _why_ women in STEM need support.

#### Stop saying "educate yourself"

Put yourself in the shoes of a right-wing edgelord again. Say you're discussing something with a leftist and they make what is to you a bold claim. You ask them to back it up and they say "educate yourself." No doubt this is because they've heard the same claim over and over again, perhaps one denouncing their identity as fake or inferior, and they don't have the time or energy to debate you because to them it isn't a _debate_, it's a struggle for their identity to be seen as valid. They don't see either of you as being on equal footing, and thus they think you have the responsibility to bear the burden of doing research. But you don't see that.

You, the right-wing edgelord _do_ in fact see this as a _debate_. You see that the phrase "educate yourself" implies a whole load of arrogance from them. They're calling you uneducated. They're telling you that you're not worth their time; that you're too stupid to be worth talking to. It's an insult, and engaging with them or their points will likely just lead to more mental anguish. Moreover, they're making you do "their work" of debating for them.

And even if you _do_ try to "educate yourself," who's to say your searches will even bear fruit? If you're on the internet, you'd've been fed right-wing content by the algorithm for ages. Why would it suddenly stop now? And why should you go through the special effort of evaluating their ideas when there are a multitude of _other_ ideas you could spend time evaluating instead? As far as you're concerned, this leftist is spewing out the equivalent of flat-earther rhetoric, an idea so ridiculous that it isn't worth any of your time nor attention. After all, there are too many ideas in the world to spend adequate time covering them all. So one has to stick to what one considers reasonable.

Honestly, even in an "ideal world" the "educate yourself" argument falls flat for exactly this reason: You can't put the onus on someone to faithfully research and consider a claim which they _think_ is utter hogwash because there are an infinite array of alternative, equally supposedly hogwash claims they could be considering. As far as they're concerned, why does _yours_ deserve special attention? You have to hook them in with a claim they consider reasonable. Telling someone to educate themselves is certainly the more _moral_ option because the situation often isn't a debate&mdash; it's a struggle to survive and to prove one's worth as a human being when such a thing should never be in the question. But it is _far_ from a _pragmatic_ option.

## Conclusion

So that's my story about how I found myself stuck within the right-wing pipeline and how I later escaped it. I don't think I have anything else worth saying here, and I don't like long, drawn-out conclusions, so I think I'll just end it here. Thank you for reading!
